http.createServer(function(request, response))
/////THE REQUEST AND RESPONSE ARE CALLBACKS//// {
	
}


fs.readFile ('etc/host', function () {
////the second function is the call back //////

//curl command line?

http.creatServer (function(request, responese {
	response.writeHead (200)- status check 
	
}
));
the first time node goes through this code it registers events 
KNOWN EVENTS (request, connnection, cose )
		- in this case the request event 

- When it's done executing it goes into an event loop

	- checking for a know event
