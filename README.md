Learn Bangla is a static web site designed to help English speakers learn Bangla or Bengali, the language spoken in Bangladesh by showing users increasingly difficult “Flash Cards”. 

The site uses a JSON dictionary file, with vocabulary words dynamically scrapped from various online dictionaries, along with their english translations and matching photo links gathered using the Flickr API. 

The front end for this site was built using React. 

I am not making any money off of this site.
